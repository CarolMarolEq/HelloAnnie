<p>Here she is in her sneakers!I'll talk a little more about these since they're pretty cool. They are called EasyBoot Cloud. Essentially they are orthopedics for horses. Horses can wear orthopedics in many different forms, including iron or steel shoes. However, for Annie the sneakers have worked the best for her so far in the last year I've owned her. Hope this was a fun read! Link to EasyBoot website below!</p>
